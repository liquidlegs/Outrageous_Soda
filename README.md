# Outrageous SODA

Outrageous SODA is a simple web fuzzer that can guess URL directory names and fuzz URL parameters.
This project is pretty bare-bones at the moment and currently offers the following features.

- Generate URI paths from a wordlist
- Display debug information, HTML responses and status codes
- Control the timeout in milliseconds between each response
- Multithreading
- Parameter fuzzing (Not implemented)
- Write all output to a file (Not implemented)
- Mostly polished CLI interface
